a="""Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level,
and interpreted programming language. It supports an Object Oriented
programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and
provides lots of high-level data structures. Python is easy to learn yet powerful and
versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application
Development.Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make
it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.Python
supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and
functional or procedural programming styles. Python is not intended to work in a
particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as a
multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise,
3D CAD, etc. We don't need to use data types to declare variables because it is
dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer
variable. Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no
compilation step included in Python development, and the edit-test-debug cycle is
very fast.
